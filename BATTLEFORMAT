Thousand Parsec Battle Data Format Specification 0.0.1.
-----------------------------

The Battle Data is a simple XML file designed to be parsed using a SAX type
parser.

There are two parts to defining Battle Data. 

 - The media definition, which includes details about where to find the required
   graphics and which weapon animations to be used.

 - The battle definition, which include details about what occured in a battle.
   This include things such as who was in the battle, who fired and what and
   what damage was done.

The media definition a either is a zip file or directory containing the
following,
 - types.xml
 - graphics required by types.xml

The types.xml looks like the following,
<battlemedia version="0.0.1">
	<type id="battleship">
	   <model>graphics/frigate/model.png</model>
	   <weaponpoints>
			   <pixel>0,10</pixel>
			   <pixel>0,20</pixel>
	   </weaponpoints>
	   <weapontype>laser2</weapontype>
	</type>
</battlemedia>

It possible things found in a type definition are as follows. All file locations
should be relative to the types.xml file and should always be below the file.
IE you can not use '..' to go above the types.xml directory.
 model        - a mng (for animation) or png (for static) picture which is
displayed during idle periods. It is also used when other media is not defined.
 death        - a mng of an explosion or death animation.
 firing       - a mng of the object "firing"
 weapontype   - A choice of the possible weapon types - Laser[1-9], Missile,
Torpedo, has no effect on game, only how the weapon fire is drawn. Each
different weapon type has a different animation.
 weapon       - A graphic for the Missile or Torpedo (no graphics for Laser)
 weaponpoints - These describe the pixel locations where weapon fire appears to
come from. There can be multiple locations. Some laser types will use all fire
locations while other types will randomly choose a location.

First the file lists all the sides and the "Entities" on each side.
Each entity must have a unique id. Recommended format is <type>-<id>-<index>.
Then the information for each object. An object is required to have:
 name        - Display name for the object.
Optional:
 description - Description of the object.
 type        - Which type to use from the media definition.

<sides>
	<side id="mithro">
		<entity id="battleship-54-1">
			<name>Mithro's Super Fleet, Battleship 1</name>
			<model>battleship/model.mng</model>
			<death>battleship/death.mng</model>
		</entity>
		<entity id="battleship-54-2">
			<name>Mithro's Super Fleet, Battleship 2</name>
			<model>battleship/model.mng</model>
			<death>battleship/death.mng</model>
		</entity>
		<entity id="planet-23">
			<name>Mithro's Colony on Omega 1</name>
			<model>planets/barren.mng</model>
		</entity>
	</side>
</sides>

Then each round is listed off. 
There are the following commands which can be used,
 log("message")                   - Prints a message 
 death(objectid)                  - Object plays death animation and then is removed from the board
 move(objectid, position)         - Object moves to a certain location.
 fire(source objectid, dest objectid)
                                  - Object plays fire animation. (Origin is pixel position the shot should appear to come from, position is the pixel position where the shot should be placed - relative to top-left of the graphic.)
 damage(objectid, number)         - Amount of damage done to an object
All commands occur at once.
